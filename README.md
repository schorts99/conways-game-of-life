# Conway's Game of Life

A dynamic implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life built with Ruby on Rails, featuring real-time interactivity via Stimulus and background processing with Sidekiq. The board state is temporarily stored and updated in the database after a 5-second delay, simulating the evolution of cellular automata.

## Features

- Interactive grid rendered with Rails views and Stimulus controllers
- Board state stored in the database and updated asynchronously
- Background job queue powered by Sidekiq
